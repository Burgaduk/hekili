        Please supply your character information by completing the following steps.
        * Log into your WoW character.
        * Type `/hekili` and press Enter.
        * Open the Issue Reporting section (left panel).
        * Copy all of the text from the text box.
        * Paste into this field.
        
        This step is essential, as most issues are related to specific classes, specializations, gear, talent choices, or other game systems.
        If you do not provide this information, I cannot triage your problem.

        **Note:** Some errors may prevent you from opening `/hekili`.  If that's true for you, please note that in this box.
